## How to define a keyboard layout
The application is very open to new keyboard key configurations (e.g. numeric keypad, AZERTY, COLEMAK, ...). All you need to do is to go to the folder with the `KeyboordUsage.exe` from here dig into the folder `Configuration/Keyboard` (browse the .json at https://github.com/kbilsted/KeyboordUsage/tree/master/code/Configuration/Keyboard). Make a copy of any of the `.json` files and start editing. After editing simply restart the application and your new configuration has been picked up.
